# Text/Image to 3D Tools

There are several tools and services that offer generation of 3D objects from text or images. We have curated the following five tools that you can get started with for free. Some of them are open source while others provide free tiers.

## Meshy
**Link**: [Meshy](https://www.mashy.ai)

Meshy is one of the best services that generates stunning 3D objects from text or images. To get started, click on ‚ÄúStart for Free‚Äù and you can log in with your existing Google account. Meshy provides you with free monthly credits, which are enough to get started and experiment.

I recommend checking out their tutorials which show you how to write good prompts for better results. **Link**: [Meshy Tutorials](https://www.meshy.ai/blog/prompt-guide)

### Features:
- Once you log in, you can discover what others have generated, check out tutorials, and start generating!
- To check out a prompt for a model, click it, and both the prompt and the negative prompt (things you don‚Äôt want in the generation) will be shown.
- To create your own 3D, click on ‚ÄúText to 3D‚Äù or ‚ÄúImage to 3D‚Äù. There are four simple steps to generate your 3D object, besides fine editing:
  1. Enter your prompt. (I highly recommend checking out the guide at [Meshy Prompt Guide](https://www.meshy.ai/blog/prompt-guide)) and select an Art Style (Auto, Realistic, Cartoon, or Low-Poly)
  2. Click on ‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù and wait for the previews to appear.
  3. Check out the previews generated by clicking on each of them.
  4. Once you find a model you like (note that this is just a preview), click on ‚ÄúRefine‚Äù to get the final generated 3D model.
- Once the final refinement is complete, it will show up in the ‚ÄúRefined‚Äù section, and you can click to view it, as well as download and use it!

### Image to 3D:
Next, you can try the ‚ÄúImage to 3D‚Äù by uploading an image. The tool provides much more than what we discussed here. You can explore the other features and discover what you can do.

# Generating 3D Objects from Text and Image

## Overview
**Project Weight**: 1  
**Project Duration**: From Apr 2, 2025 12:00 AM to Apr 3, 2025 12:00 AM  
**Auto Review**: Launched at the deadline  
**Auto QA Review**: 1.0/1 mandatory  
**Altogether**: 100.0%  
**Mandatory**: 100.0%  
**Optional**: No optional tasks  

### In a Nutshell‚Ä¶
Imagine transforming written words or simple images into tangible, three-dimensional objects with a few clicks. No more painstaking hours crafting complex 3D models. Text and image-to-3D conversion breathes life into ideas and creations easily.

In traditional 3D modeling, artists and designers spend countless hours shaping virtual clay, manipulating polygons, and fine-tuning details. This process is time-consuming and labor-intensive and requires specialized software and spatial awareness. Text and image to 3D technology revolutionizes this landscape, offering a streamlined approach. Advanced algorithms transform simple text or image files into intricate 3D models, ready for visualization, prototyping, or 3D printing.

Discover the power of image/text to 3D generative AI in this project!
